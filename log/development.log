According to the claimant the injury was of a \"repetitive motion\" nature affecting the bilateral upper extremities and his back. On December 5, 2011, the claimant received an anterior/posterior lumbar fusion. According to the operative report there were no complications with procedure. On June 13, 2011, Carl H. Shin, MD, examined the claimant. The claimant was re-evaluated for carpal tunnel syndrome bilaterally. At the time, the claimant's chief complaint was pain and numbness in the first three digits of both hands, sleep disturbance and pain ranging from six to eight on a visual analog scale (VAS) of zero to ten, with zero reflecting no pain and ten reflecting the most intense pain. The claimant was not working at the time of the examination and a complete review of systems and physical examination were conducted. The treatment plan included a repeat electromyogram study to determine nerve damage, a referral to a hand specialist, continuation of gabapentin with increasing dosage to 600 mg twice daily and reevaluation in four weeks. In a consultation report dated September 7, 2011, the claimant was evaluated for low back and bilateral leg pain, as well as, neck pain. According to the claimant he was not working and the claimant stated he was not currently taking any medication but objective findings noted some significant weakness in the right foot, both plantarflexors and dorsiflexors. The claimant was able to bend to thirty degrees and extend without any extension job. The treatment plan included: obtaining an MRI of lumbar spine, pharmacotherapy to include pain medication, anti-inflammatory medication and muscle relaxants as well as a topical pain cream for numbness and neuropathic pain. In a progress report dated October 5, 2011, the claimant was diagnosed with a lumbar herniated disc. The lower extremity exam was unchanged from last visit. The claimant complained of pain with any activity and he stated that only rest improved the pain. Findings from the MRI showed anterior listhesis of L4 over L5, spinal stenosis of L2-L3 and foraminal stenosis in level of L2 and L3 bilaterally. The treatment plan includes an epidural injection of the lumbar spine, a nerve conduction study of the lower extremities and continuation of medications. The claimant was also counseled regarding spine care and activities. Ardavan Aslie, MD conducted a follow up exam on November 2, 2011. The patient was seen for a follow-up examination. The claimant stated that the nerve conduction study \"bothered\" him and that he was pain. The claimant reported that pain started in the back and radiated down his legs, bilaterally. The lower extremity examination remained unchanged from the last visit. A Waddell sign was absent. The claimant's pathology showed severe spinal stenosis at the levels of L2-L3 and L3-L4. The treatment plan was to proceed with an epidural injection, however, the claimant did not want to proceed as he was in too much pain and did not believe that the injections helped. L2-L3 and L3-L4 anterior/posterior decompression and fusion surgery was offered and explained and the claimant stated he wanted to proceed with surgery. Evaluation and counseling of medication use was also conducted at this time. On December 5, 2011, the claimant received an anterior L2-3 fusion and a posterior L2-3 fusion on the following day. On March 14, 2012, Ardavan Aslie, MD examined the claimant where the chief complain was residual pain in the lumbar spine. The claimant stated that he believed surgery helped him. The lower extremity examination findings were unchanged. Sensation was decreased at the level of L5 bilaterally and a Waddell sign was absent. The claimant had not healed from surgery at the time and was instructed to be careful with his back. Physician noted significant instability at L4-L5 area that was discovered during surgery and the claimant was counseled regarding activities and medication use. Ardavan Aslie, MD examined the Claimant on April 11, 2012 and the claimant reported that he increased the distance that he could walk but was still experiencing low back and bilateral leg pain. Objective findings concluded that the incisions were healing with no signs of infection, A Waddell sign was absent and plantarflexors and dorsiflexors were slightly stronger since pre-op. The physician reported that the claimant had actually a two-level severe spinal stenosis and that he should continue with current management. An evaluation and counseling of medications and currently activities were conducted. The claimant received physical therapy on March 23, 2011, April 14, 2011, April 21, 2011, April 25, 2011, April 28, 2011, May 2, 2011, May 5, 2011, and May 9, 2011.

According to the claimant the injury was of a \"repetitive motion\" nature affecting the bilateral upper extremities and his back. On December 5, 2011, the claimant received an anterior/posterior lumbar fusion. According to the operative report there were no complications with procedure. On June 13, 2011, Carl H. Shin, MD, examined the claimant. The claimant was re-evaluated for carpal tunnel syndrome bilaterally. At the time, the claimant's chief complaint was pain and numbness in the first three digits of both hands, sleep disturbance and pain ranging from six to eight on a visual analog scale (VAS) of zero to ten, with zero reflecting no pain and ten reflecting the most intense pain. The claimant was not working at the time of the examination and a complete review of systems and physical examination were conducted. The treatment plan included a repeat electromyogram study to determine nerve damage, a referral to a hand specialist, continuation of gabapentin with increasing dosage to 600 mg twice daily and reevaluation in four weeks. In a consultation report dated September 7, 2011, the claimant was evaluated for low back and bilateral leg pain, as well as, neck pain. According to the claimant he was not working and the claimant stated he was not currently taking any medication but objective findings noted some significant weakness in the right foot, both plantarflexors and dorsiflexors. The claimant was able to bend to thirty degrees and extend without any extension job. The treatment plan included: obtaining an MRI of lumbar spine, pharmacotherapy to include pain medication, anti-inflammatory medication and muscle relaxants as well as a topical pain cream for numbness and neuropathic pain. In a progress report dated October 5, 2011, the claimant was diagnosed with a lumbar herniated disc. The lower extremity exam was unchanged from last visit. The claimant complained of pain with any activity and he stated that only rest improved the pain. Findings from the MRI showed anterior listhesis of L4 over L5, spinal stenosis of L2-L3 and foraminal stenosis in level of L2 and L3 bilaterally. The treatment plan includes an epidural injection of the lumbar spine, a nerve conduction study of the lower extremities and continuation of medications. The claimant was also counseled regarding spine care and activities. Ardavan Aslie, MD conducted a follow up exam on November 2, 2011. The patient was seen for a follow-up examination. The claimant stated that the nerve conduction study \"bothered\" him and that he was pain. The claimant reported that pain started in the back and radiated down his legs, bilaterally. The lower extremity examination remained unchanged from the last visit. A Waddell sign was absent. The claimant's pathology showed severe spinal stenosis at the levels of L2-L3 and L3-L4. The treatment plan was to proceed with an epidural injection, however, the claimant did not want to proceed as he was in too much pain and did not believe that the injections helped. L2-L3 and L3-L4 anterior/posterior decompression and fusion surgery was offered and explained and the claimant stated he wanted to proceed with surgery. Evaluation and counseling of medication use was also conducted at this time. On December 5, 2011, the claimant received an anterior L2-3 fusion and a posterior L2-3 fusion on the following day. On March 14, 2012, Ardavan Aslie, MD examined the claimant where the chief complain was residual pain in the lumbar spine. The claimant stated that he believed surgery helped him. The lower extremity examination findings were unchanged. Sensation was decreased at the level of L5 bilaterally and a Waddell sign was absent. The claimant had not healed from surgery at the time and was instructed to be careful with his back. Physician noted significant instability at L4-L5 area that was discovered during surgery and the claimant was counseled regarding activities and medication use. Ardavan Aslie, MD examined the Claimant on April 11, 2012 and the claimant reported that he increased the distance that he could walk but was still experiencing low back and bilateral leg pain. Objective findings concluded that the incisions were healing with no signs of infection, A Waddell sign was absent and plantarflexors and dorsiflexors were slightly stronger since pre-op. The physician reported that the claimant had actually a two-level severe spinal stenosis and that he should continue with current management. An evaluation and counseling of medications and currently activities were conducted. The claimant received physical therapy on March 23, 2011, April 14, 2011, April 21, 2011, April 25, 2011, April 28, 2011, May 2, 2011, May 5, 2011, and May 9, 2011.

According to the claimant the injury was of a \"repetitive motion\" nature affecting the bilateral upper extremities and his back. On December 5, 2011, the claimant received an anterior/posterior lumbar fusion. According to the operative report there were no complications with procedure. On June 13, 2011, Carl H. Shin, MD, examined the claimant. The claimant was re-evaluated for carpal tunnel syndrome bilaterally. At the time, the claimant's chief complaint was pain and numbness in the first three digits of both hands, sleep disturbance and pain ranging from six to eight on a visual analog scale (VAS) of zero to ten, with zero reflecting no pain and ten reflecting the most intense pain. The claimant was not working at the time of the examination and a complete review of systems and physical examination were conducted. The treatment plan included a repeat electromyogram study to determine nerve damage, a referral to a hand specialist, continuation of gabapentin with increasing dosage to 600 mg twice daily and reevaluation in four weeks. In a consultation report dated September 7, 2011, the claimant was evaluated for low back and bilateral leg pain, as well as, neck pain. According to the claimant he was not working and the claimant stated he was not currently taking any medication but objective findings noted some significant weakness in the right foot, both plantarflexors and dorsiflexors. The claimant was able to bend to thirty degrees and extend without any extension job. The treatment plan included: obtaining an MRI of lumbar spine, pharmacotherapy to include pain medication, anti-inflammatory medication and muscle relaxants as well as a topical pain cream for numbness and neuropathic pain. In a progress report dated October 5, 2011, the claimant was diagnosed with a lumbar herniated disc. The lower extremity exam was unchanged from last visit. The claimant complained of pain with any activity and he stated that only rest improved the pain. Findings from the MRI showed anterior listhesis of L4 over L5, spinal stenosis of L2-L3 and foraminal stenosis in level of L2 and L3 bilaterally. The treatment plan includes an epidural injection of the lumbar spine, a nerve conduction study of the lower extremities and continuation of medications. The claimant was also counseled regarding spine care and activities. Ardavan Aslie, MD conducted a follow up exam on November 2, 2011. The patient was seen for a follow-up examination. The claimant stated that the nerve conduction study \"bothered\" him and that he was pain. The claimant reported that pain started in the back and radiated down his legs, bilaterally. The lower extremity examination remained unchanged from the last visit. A Waddell sign was absent. The claimant's pathology showed severe spinal stenosis at the levels of L2-L3 and L3-L4. The treatment plan was to proceed with an epidural injection, however, the claimant did not want to proceed as he was in too much pain and did not believe that the injections helped. L2-L3 and L3-L4 anterior/posterior decompression and fusion surgery was offered and explained and the claimant stated he wanted to proceed with surgery. Evaluation and counseling of medication use was also conducted at this time. On December 5, 2011, the claimant received an anterior L2-3 fusion and a posterior L2-3 fusion on the following day. On March 14, 2012, Ardavan Aslie, MD examined the claimant where the chief complain was residual pain in the lumbar spine. The claimant stated that he believed surgery helped him. The lower extremity examination findings were unchanged. Sensation was decreased at the level of L5 bilaterally and a Waddell sign was absent. The claimant had not healed from surgery at the time and was instructed to be careful with his back. Physician noted significant instability at L4-L5 area that was discovered during surgery and the claimant was counseled regarding activities and medication use. Ardavan Aslie, MD examined the Claimant on April 11, 2012 and the claimant reported that he increased the distance that he could walk but was still experiencing low back and bilateral leg pain. Objective findings concluded that the incisions were healing with no signs of infection, A Waddell sign was absent and plantarflexors and dorsiflexors were slightly stronger since pre-op. The physician reported that the claimant had actually a two-level severe spinal stenosis and that he should continue with current management. An evaluation and counseling of medications and currently activities were conducted. The claimant received physical therapy on March 23, 2011, April 14, 2011, April 21, 2011, April 25, 2011, April 28, 2011, May 2, 2011, May 5, 2011, and May 9, 2011. In a progress report dated May 12, 2011 by Sharon Gaebler, OTR, CHT, the claimant reported that he was limited to 'five minutes of activity before hands give out.\" The treatment plan at that time was to discharge to an independent home exercise program. In a review of prescriptions, the claimant received the following prescriptions between August 5, 2010 and March 3, 2012: Celebrex, 200 mg, Gabapentin, 300 mg; Tramadol HCL 50 mg; Dendracin Neurodendraxcin, 0.0375-10-20%; Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen 10-325 mg, ciprofloxacin and Amox TR potassium Clavulana. \"\r\n", "rationale"=>"\"Cost Savings Analysis (Based on a remaining life expectancy of 25.0 years per the National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 59, No. 9, September 28, 2011) Theramine 450mg #90 invoice priced at $302.73 for a 30 day supply translates to $302.73 monthly, $3,684.75 annually and $92,143.44 for the claimant's remaining life expectancy of 25 years.

According to the claimant the injury was of a \"repetitive motion\" nature affecting the bilateral upper extremities and his back. On December 5, 2011, the claimant received an anterior/posterior lumbar fusion. According to the operative report there were no complications with procedure. On June 13, 2011, Carl H. Shin, MD, examined the claimant. The claimant was re-evaluated for carpal tunnel syndrome bilaterally. At the time, the claimant's chief complaint was pain and numbness in the first three digits of both hands, sleep disturbance and pain ranging from six to eight on a visual analog scale (VAS) of zero to ten, with zero reflecting no pain and ten reflecting the most intense pain. The claimant was not working at the time of the examination and a complete review of systems and physical examination were conducted. The treatment plan included a repeat electromyogram study to determine nerve damage, a referral to a hand specialist, continuation of gabapentin with increasing dosage to 600 mg twice daily and reevaluation in four weeks. In a consultation report dated September 7, 2011, the claimant was evaluated for low back and bilateral leg pain, as well as, neck pain. According to the claimant he was not working and the claimant stated he was not currently taking any medication but objective findings noted some significant weakness in the right foot, both plantarflexors and dorsiflexors. The claimant was able to bend to thirty degrees and extend without any extension job. The treatment plan included: obtaining an MRI of lumbar spine, pharmacotherapy to include pain medication, anti-inflammatory medication and muscle relaxants as well as a topical pain cream for numbness and neuropathic pain. In a progress report dated October 5, 2011, the claimant was diagnosed with a lumbar herniated disc. The lower extremity exam was unchanged from last visit. The claimant complained of pain with any activity and he stated that only rest improved the pain. Findings from the MRI showed anterior listhesis of L4 over L5, spinal stenosis of L2-L3 and foraminal stenosis in level of L2 and L3 bilaterally. The treatment plan includes an epidural injection of the lumbar spine, a nerve conduction study of the lower extremities and continuation of medications. The claimant was also counseled regarding spine care and activities. Ardavan Aslie, MD conducted a follow up exam on November 2, 2011. The patient was seen for a follow-up examination. The claimant stated that the nerve conduction study \"bothered\" him and that he was pain. The claimant reported that pain started in the back and radiated down his legs, bilaterally. The lower extremity examination remained unchanged from the last visit. A Waddell sign was absent. The claimant's pathology showed severe spinal stenosis at the levels of L2-L3 and L3-L4. The treatment plan was to proceed with an epidural injection, however, the claimant did not want to proceed as he was in too much pain and did not believe that the injections helped. L2-L3 and L3-L4 anterior/posterior decompression and fusion surgery was offered and explained and the claimant stated he wanted to proceed with surgery. Evaluation and counseling of medication use was also conducted at this time. On December 5, 2011, the claimant received an anterior L2-3 fusion and a posterior L2-3 fusion on the following day. On March 14, 2012, Ardavan Aslie, MD examined the claimant where the chief complain was residual pain in the lumbar spine. The claimant stated that he believed surgery helped him. The lower extremity examination findings were unchanged. Sensation was decreased at the level of L5 bilaterally and a Waddell sign was absent. The claimant had not healed from surgery at the time and was instructed to be careful with his back. Physician noted significant instability at L4-L5 area that was discovered during surgery and the claimant was counseled regarding activities and medication use. Ardavan Aslie, MD examined the Claimant on April 11, 2012 and the claimant reported that he increased the distance that he could walk but was still experiencing low back and bilateral leg pain. Objective findings concluded that the incisions were healing with no signs of infection, A Waddell sign was absent and plantarflexors and dorsiflexors were slightly stronger since pre-op. The physician reported that the claimant had actually a two-level severe spinal stenosis and that he should continue with current management. An evaluation and counseling of medications and currently activities were conducted. The claimant received physical therapy on March 23, 2011, April 14, 2011, April 21, 2011, April 25, 2011, April 28, 2011, May 2, 2011, May 5, 2011, and May 9, 2011. In a progress report dated May 12, 2011 by Sharon Gaebler, OTR, CHT, the claimant reported that he was limited to 'five minutes of activity before hands give out.\" The treatment plan at that time was to discharge to an independent home exercise program. In a review of prescriptions, the claimant received the following prescriptions between August 5, 2010 and March 3, 2012: Celebrex, 200 mg, Gabapentin, 300 mg; Tramadol HCL 50 mg; Dendracin Neurodendraxcin, 0.0375-10-20%; Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen 10-325 mg, ciprofloxacin and Amox TR potassium Clavulana. \"\r\n", "rationale"=>"\"Cost Savings Analysis (Based on a remaining life expectancy of 25.0 years per the National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 59, No. 9, September 28, 2011) Theramine 450mg #90 invoice priced at $302.73 for a 30 day supply translates to $302.73 monthly, $3,684.75 annually and $92,143.44 for the claimant's remaining life expectancy of 25 years.
